Sorry that this post is not about business or any related topics. But this issue is directly related to us.

After you watch the movie “An Inconvenient Truth”, you sure can feel the passion of Al Gore on the problems of global warming. He has made the same presentation all over the world for more than 1000 times. He didn’t earn any money from that. He just wants to save the world.

I heard about global warming for many many years but this is the first time I have such a strong feeling about this issue. I would say this movie has somehow changed my life in some ways. I hope you guys can take a look of this movie when the DVD comes out later. Good Luck everyone. =)
